# par-open-source
**P**roject **A**lpine: **R**emastered **Open Source** is the oepn source repository for Project Alpine: Remastered. This repository has code examples, open-source modules, frameworks, system-level components, etc. Each and every one of the included stuff in this repository will have everything you need to compile them and use it in your own software, or perhaps you could make your own build of iOS/macOS with these!

# What's Included
At the very moment, we don't have a lot, but it will be updated in the coming days, months, or years. Just wait and see!

The following software is included:
- MobileDevice-1.0
- Customization.framework (Customization-1.0)

# Disclaimers
While we have open source software, there may be times when we have to use **PrivateFrameworks** for certain functions to work. If you are using open source software from us, you are eligible for your app to only use **2 PrivateFrameworks**. If you intend on publishing your app with these frameworks, your app **MUST GO THROUGH REVIEW**. And, while the software is open-source, **they are in a developmental stage**, and it is heavily discouraged from using them in your production application.
